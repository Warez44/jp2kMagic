## Contents of this repository
This repository contains:

1. Updated *magic* signatures for the *JPEG 2000* family of file formats, and *JPEG 2000* codestreams. This allows *File* to distinguish between the *JP2*, *JPX*, *JPM* and *MJ2* formats. 
2. A small set of sample images that represent each of the above formats.

## *Magic* signature
The directory [*magic*][magic] contains the following files:

+ [*Magic file with JPEG 2000 signature*][magicUncompiled] (uncompiled)
+ [*Magic file with updated JPEG 2000 signature*][magicCompiled] (compiled)

Note that these signatures are intended as a replacement of the existing *JPEG 2000 image data* signature by David Santinoli (on which it is based), and the *JPEG-2000 Code Stream Bitmap data* signature by Petr Splichal, which ended with an `\x00` byte that shouldn't be included as this byte is part of a variable (*Lsiz*).

Also note that the first signature uses a two-step process for identification: first it looks for the generic *JPEG 2000* signature (which is shared by all these formats), then it uses the *Brand* field in the *File Type Box* to establish the sub-format. If the second step yields no match (e.g. because the *Brand* field contains an unknown value or is corrupted) the identification result is simply "JPEG 2000" (without any sub-format information).

### Compiling on your own system
Download the uncompiled file (`jpeg2000Magic`) and compile it using:

`file -C -m jpeg2000Magic`

This should produce a compiled *magic* file called `jpeg2000Magic.mgc` which can be used as input to *File* by using its `-m` switch.

## JPEG 2000 sample images
The directory [*sampleImages*][sampleImages] contains one sample image for each of the *JPEG 2000* file formats:

+ [*balloon.jp2*][sampleJP2] - [JPEG 2000 Part 1][JP2] (JP2) image, created using [Aware JPEG 2000 SDK][Aware] <sup>*</sup>

+ [*balloon.jpf*][sampleJPX] - [JPEG 2000 Part 2][JPX] (JPX) image, created using [Kakadu][Kakadu] 6.4 *

+ [*balloon.jpm*][sampleJPM] - [JPEG 2000 Part 6][JPM] (JPM) image, created using [Luratech JPEG 2000 plugin][Luratech] for [IrfanView][IrfanView] <sup>*</sup>

+ [*balloon.j2c*][sampleJ2C] - JPEG 2000 Codestream, created using [Kakadu][Kakadu] 7.1 *


+ [*Speedway.mj2*][sampleMJ2] - [JPEG 2000 Part 3][MJ2] (MJ2) video (aka "motion JPEG 2000"), created using [OpenJPEG][OpenJPEG] <sup>\#</sup>

Note that the standard file extension of *JPX* files is `.jpf` (section M.2.1 of the [specification][JPX]):

> When stored in traditional computer file systems, JPX files
> should be given the file extension ".jpf" (readers should allow mixed case).

Stand-alone *JPEG 2000* codestreams are pretty rare (they're usually embedded within the other formats), but they do exist. File extensions vary, but `.j2c` is often used.

## Known issues
*JPX* images that were created in *Photoshop* using *Adobe*'s *JPEG 2000* plugin wil be identified as *JP2*. This is because the plugin inserts a wrong value in the 'brand' field of these files. This is simply a bug in the plugin and not a fault of this signature.
